# File_Organiser-using-Python
It's a Python script that elegantly organizes your folder by file type, creating dedicated directories for each specific file category, streamlining your digital workspace effortlessly.


Define the file extensions and their corresponding categories in the script. By default, categories like "Images," "PDF," "Videos," "Documents," and more have already been set up. You can customize this list according to your needs.

Run the script using a Python interpreter. It will automatically categorize the files in the specified folder and move them to their respective category folders.

Supported File Categories
The script currently supports organizing files into the following categories:

  Images
  PDF
  Videos
  Text Documents
  Word Documents
  Spreadsheets
  Presentations
  HTML
  XML
  Markdown
  CSV
  JSON
  Plain Text
  Databases
  Compressed
  Executables
  Other (Files with unsupported extensions)

Example
  Suppose you run the script on your "Downloads" folder. If the folder contains a file named "example.jpg," it will be moved   to the "Images" folder. Similarly, a file named "document.docx" will be moved to the "Word Documents" folder.

Customization
  You can easily customize the categories and file extensions to suit your specific requirements. Just edit the respective   lists in the script.
